# GNN-Knowledge-Graphs
GNN framework for class-imbalanced knowledge graphs

Implementation of the baseline RGCN model (Ref: [1]) for knowledge graph embeddings. The same framework could be used later to develop a new architecture.

To train and save the model, run `python train_model.py`

To compute performance metrics on the test set, run `python inference.py`
